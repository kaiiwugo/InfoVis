# InfoVis
The goal of this project is to examine data around drug use in college. We tackled the question of 'do college campuses create an enviroment that leads to excessive drug and alcohol consumption?' Our presentation indludes lots of visualizations, as well as two interactive visualizations. Based on the data, we conclude that college campuses don't premote excessive drug use but instead facots like age and region play a bigger role.
